				<h3>Life and Experiences</h3>
				<p>Born to a family with limited means in German-speaking Silesia, Mendel was raised in a rural setting. His
					academic abilities were recognized by the local priest, who persuaded his parents to send him away to school
					at the age of 11. His Gymnasium (grammar school) studies completed in 1840, Mendel entered a two-year program
					in philosophy at the Philosophical Institute of the University of Olmütz (Olomouc, Czech Republic), where he
					excelled in physics and mathematics, completing his studies in 1843. His initial years away from home were
					hard, because his family could not sufficiently support him. He tutored other students to make ends meet, and
					twice he suffered serious depression and had to return home to recover. As his father’s only son, Mendel was
					expected to take over the small family farm, but he preferred a different solution to his predicament,
					choosing to enter the Altbrünn monastery as a novitiate of the Augustinian order, where he was given the name
					Gregor.</p>

					<img src="Pictures/Gregor_Mendel.jpg" alt="A picture of Gregor Johann Mendel" class="float-end"
						style="width: 100%;">
				</a>

				<p>The move to the monastery took him to Brünn, the capital of Moravia, where for the first time he was freed
					from the harsh struggle of former years. He was also introduced to a diverse and intellectual community. As a
					priest, Mendel found his parish duty to visit the sick and dying so distressing that he again became ill.
					Abbot Cyril Napp found him a substitute-teaching position at Znaim (Znojmo, Czech Republic), where he proved
					very successful. However, in 1850 Mendel failed an exam—introduced through new legislation for teacher
					certification—and was sent to the University of Vienna for two years to benefit from a new program of
					scientific instruction. As at Olmütz, Mendel devoted his time at Vienna to physics and mathematics, working
					under Austrian physicist Christian Doppler and mathematical physicist Andreas von Ettinghausen. He also
					studied the anatomy and physiology of plants and the use of the microscope under botanist Franz Unger, an
					enthusiast for the cell theory and a supporter of the developmentalist (pre-Darwinian) view of the evolution
					of life. Unger’s writings on the latter made him a target for attack by the Roman Catholic press of Vienna
					shortly before and during Mendel’s time there.</p>

				<p>In the summer of 1853, Mendel returned to the monastery in Brünn, and in the following year he was again
					given a teaching position, this time at the Brünn Realschule (secondary school), where he remained until
					elected abbot 14 years later. He attempted the teacher exam again in 1856, although the event caused a nervous
					breakdown and a second failure. However, these years were his greatest in terms of success both as teacher and
					as consummate experimentalist. Once abbot, his administrative duties came to occupy the majority of his time.
					Moreover, Mendel’s refusal to permit the monastery to pay the state’s new taxes for a religious fund led to
					his involvement in a long and bitter dispute with the authorities. Convinced that this tax was
					unconstitutional, he continued his opposition, refusing to comply even when the state took over the
					administration of some of the monastery’s estates and directed the profits to the religious fund.</p>

				<p>In 1854 Abbot Cyril Napp permitted Mendel to plan a major experimental program in hybridization at the
					monastery. The aim of this program was to trace the transmission of hereditary characters in successive
					generations of hybrid progeny. Previous authorities had observed that progeny of fertile hybrids tended to
					revert to the originating species, and they had therefore concluded that hybridization could not be a
					mechanism used by nature to multiply species—though in exceptional cases some fertile hybrids did appear not
					to revert (the so-called “constant hybrids”). On the other hand, plant and animal breeders had long shown that
					crossbreeding could indeed produce a multitude of new forms. The latter point was of particular interest to
					landowners, including the abbot of the monastery, who was concerned about the monastery’s future profits from
					the wool of its Merino sheep, owing to competing wool being supplied from Australia.</p>

				</a>

				<p>Mendel chose to conduct his studies with the edible pea (Pisum sativum) because of the numerous distinct
					varieties, the ease of culture and control of pollination, and the high proportion of successful seed
					germinations. From 1854 to 1856 he tested 34 varieties for constancy of their traits. In order to trace the
					transmission of characters, he chose seven traits that were expressed in a distinctive manner, such as plant
					height (short or tall) and seed colour (green or yellow). He referred to these alternatives as contrasted
					characters, or character-pairs. He crossed varieties that differed in one trait—for instance, tall crossed
					with short. The first generation of hybrids (F1) displayed the character of one variety but not that of the
					other. In Mendel’s terms, one character was dominant and the other recessive. In the numerous progeny that he
					raised from these hybrids (the second generation, F2), however, the recessive character reappeared, and the
					proportion of offspring bearing the dominant to offspring bearing the recessive was very close to a 3 to 1
					ratio. Study of the descendants (F3) of the dominant group showed that one-third of them were true-breeding
					and two-thirds were of hybrid constitution. The 3:1 ratio could hence be rewritten as 1:2:1, meaning that 50
					percent of the F2 generation were true-breeding and 50 percent were still hybrid. This was Mendel’s major
					discovery, and it was unlikely to have been made by his predecessors, since they did not grow statistically
					significant populations, nor did they follow the individual characters separately to establish their
					statistical relations.</p>

				<p>Mendel realized further that he could test his expectation that the seven traits are transmitted
					independently of one another. Crosses involving first two and then three of his seven traits yielded
					categories of offspring in proportions following the terms produced from combining two binomial equations,
					indicating that their transmission was independent of one another. Mendel’s successors have called this
					conclusion the law of independent assortment.</p>

				<p>Mendel went on to relate his results to the cell theory of fertilization, according to which a new organism
					is generated from the fusion of two cells. In order for pure breeding forms of both the dominant and the
					recessive type to be brought into the hybrid, there had to be some temporary accommodation of the two
					differing characters in the hybrid as well as a separation process in the formation of the pollen cells and
					the egg cells. In other words, the hybrid must form germ cells bearing the potential to yield either the one
					characteristic or the other. This has since been described as the law of segregation, or the doctrine of the
					purity of the germ cells. Since one pollen cell fuses with one egg cell, all possible combinations of the
					differing pollen and egg cells would yield just the results suggested by Mendel’s combinatorial theory.</p>

				<p>Mendel first presented his results in two separate lectures in 1865 to the Natural Science Society in Brünn.
					His paper “Experiments on Plant Hybrids” was published in the society’s journal, Verhandlungen des
					naturforschenden Vereines in Brünn, the following year. It attracted little attention, although many libraries
					received it and reprints were sentw out. The tendency of those who read it was to conclude that Mendel had
					simply demonstrated more accurately what was already widely assumed—namely, that hybrid progeny revert to
					their originating forms. They overlooked the potential for variability and the evolutionary implications that
					his demonstration of the recombination of traits made possible. Most notably, Swiss botanist Karl Wilhelm von
					Nägeli actually corresponded with Mendel, despite remaining skeptical as to the significance of his results
					and doubting that the germ cells in hybrids could be pure.</p>

				<p>Mendel appears to have made no effort to publicize his work, and it is not known how many reprints of his
					paper he distributed. He had ordered 40 reprints, the whereabouts of only eight of which are known. Other than
					the journal that published his paper, 15 sources are known from the 19th century in which Mendel is mentioned
					in the context of plant hybridization. Few of these provide a clear picture of his achievement, and most are
					very brief.</p>

				<p>By 1871 Mendel had only enough time to continue his meteorological and apicultural work. He traveled little,
					and his only visit to England was to see the Industrial Exhibition in 1862. Bright disease made his last years
					painful, and he died at the age of 61. Mendel’s funeral was attended by many mourners and proceeded from the
					monastery to the monastery’s burial plot in the town’s central cemetery, where his grave can be seen today. He
					was survived by two sisters and three nephews.</p>

				<h3>Works</h3>
				<p>Gregor Mendel, through his work on pea plants, discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance. He deduced
					that genes come in pairs and are inherited as distinct units, one from each parent. Mendel tracked the
					segregation of parental genes and their appearance in the offspring as dominant or recessive traits. He
					recognized the mathematical patterns of inheritance from one generation to the next. Mendel's Laws of Heredity
					are usually stated as:</p>

				<!-- <dl>
										<dt>Law of Dominance</dt>
										<dd>An organism with alternate forms of a gene will express the form that is dominant.</dd>
										<dt>Law of Multiple Allelism</dt>
										<dd>Multiple alleles is a type of non-Mendelian inheritance pattern that involves more than just the typical two alleles that usually code for a certain characteristic in a species. With multiple alleles, that means there are more than two phenotypes available depending on the dominant or recessive alleles that are available in the trait and the dominance pattern the individual alleles follow when combined together. Gregor Mendel only studied traits in his pea plants that showed simple or complete dominance and had only two alleles that could contribute to any one trait the plant showed. It wasn't until later that it was discovered that some traits can have more than two alleles that code for their phenotypes. This allowed many more phenotypes to be visible for any given trait while still following Mendel's Laws of Inheritance. Most of the time, when multiple alleles come into play for a trait, there is a mix of types of dominance patterns that occur. Sometimes, one of the alleles is completely recessive to the others and will be masked by any of those that are dominant to it. Other alleles may be co-dominant together and show their traits equally in the phenotype of the individual.</dd>
										<dt>Law of Segregation</dt>
										<dd>Each inherited trait is defined by a gene pair. Parental genes are randomly separated to the sex cells so that sex cells contain only one gene of the pair. Offspring therefore inherit one genetic allele from each parent when sex cells unite in fertilization.</dd>
										<dt>Law of Independent Assortment</dt>
										<dd>Genes for different traits are sorted separately from one another so that the inheritance of one trait is not dependent on the inheritance of another.</dd>

				<p>The genetic experiments Mendel did with pea plants took him eight years (1856-1863) and he published his results in 1865. During this time, Mendel grew over 10,000 pea plants, keeping track of progeny number and type. Mendel's work and his Laws of Inheritance were not appreciated in his time. It wasn't until 1900, after the rediscovery of his Laws, that his experimental results were understood.</p>
